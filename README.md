# Machine-Learning-Walker
A machine learning project using a genetic algorithm made in Unity Engine
To run the program:
1. Download Unity Engine(any 2019 version will work)
2. Download the build.zip and unzip it.
3. Run EthanWalker.exe

This project is a genetic algorithm machine learning tutorial from Dr.Penny de Byl's Udemy course, A Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning:

The project works like this:Each generation lasts only 5 seconds. If a walker falls off a platform, they die and their"genes" are not
passed onto the next generation. Before long, the walkers carry enough of the previous survivors' genes to know that staying still
or jumping in place is the best way to survive. It's a simple genetic algorithm but it helped me start learning about machine learning!
